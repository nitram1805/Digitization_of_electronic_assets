What we want to have:

Relationship between power consumption and outflow -> more interesting than rpm vs outflow
For each pump individually and maybe fit a combined model. But that seems to be very hard.
Is there a relationship between outflow and hight? 
-> yes there should be but we are missing input data or at least somthing about the size of the tank

What do we have
static outflow over pump 1 speed


Changes to the activation function RReLU yields significant improvements in the prediction.
